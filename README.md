# Multi-Label Respiratory Disease Prediction      
Done by: Abigail Tan, Mandis Loh, Tan Kay Wee      

## Executive Summary     
While chest X-ray technology is widely used for disease detection, the interpretation of these images by radiologists presents challenges due to the complexity of thoracic conditions and the scarcity of qualified professionals. Leveraging deep learning models offers promising potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. However, addressing the complexity of multi-label disease classification remains a significant hurdle. We aim to investigate the feasibility of lightweight deep learning models for multi-label disease detection, comparing state-of-the-art architectures like ResNet, AlexNet, and DenseNet with custom models. The findings from this study aim to contribute valuable insights to the development of improved diagnostic tools, ultimately advancing patient care in lung disease detection.
